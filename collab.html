<!-- Students -->

	<p> <b> Valeria Villegas-Medina</b></p>
	<p>Valeria was born in the lush Yakima Valley of Washington state and raised in Salt Lake City, Utah. A nontraditional student, Valeria earned an AS in Mathematics from Salt Lake Community College in 2017 before completing a BS in Physics and Mathematics from Westminster College in 2019. Her previous research experience includes determining the metallicity of ab-type RR Lyrae stars, creating a scale-free artificial network to model the growth of the early universe, and searching for binary star systems in the Praesepe open cluster. When not daydreaming about the fundamental nature of reality, Valeria enjoys eating, cooking, reading, creating and discovering new music, as well as enjoying art in all its forms.
	<BR><i> This fall Valeria will begin a post-baccalaureate program in physics at Washington University in St. Louis before applying to graduate programs in fundamental/mathematical physics. </i>
	</p>

	<p> <b> Amanda Ash </b></p>
	<p> Amanda is in the last few years pursuing her bachelor’s degree in physics from the University of North Georgia. She expects to earn her degree in Spring 2021. Since summer 2018, she has pursued research with UNG studying starspots, and comparing stellar models to observation. In Summer 2019, she worked at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian as a part of an NSF REU program. She worked with me to correlate rotational phase and intensity of the H⍺ line for K and M dwarfs in the Praesepe open cluster.
		<!-- Amanda worked with me during Summer 2019, as part of the astrophysics REU at the CfA. She analyzed spectroscopy data taken at MDM during K2 Campaign 16 observations of the Praesepe cluster. Amanda measured the strength of H-alpha emission in a sample of low-mass Praesepe members, and correlated their activity variability with photometric variability. -->
	<BR><i> Amanda is currently a junior at the University of North Georgia, where she works with Dr. Greg Feiden on analyzing magnetic fields of Praesepe stars using multi-band photometry. </i>

	<p> <b> Jose Perez-Chavez </b></p>
	<p> Jose began working with me during Summer 2019, as part of the Banneker Institute.
	<BR><i> Jose is currently a senior at the University of Arizona. </i>
