		<!-- What am I actually trying to say here? Who is the audience?
	       I think in looking at this as both website design and prep for
			   my app statements, I'm not picking an audience. The audience for
			   the webpage should be undergrads and maybe public folks, largely
			   non-astronomers or non-cool-stars folks. The app materials can
			   be more technical; it look like most folks might give a 1-2
			   paragraph overview, then have 2-3 sections with 2-3 paragraphs each
			   giving details about areas of research (I like what Ryan does with
				 his glossary, too) -->


		<p><b>Stellar rotation in open clusters</b></p>
		<p> The core of my research is using open clusters to calibrate the evolution of stellar rotation.
		Open clusters are collections of stars that all share the same age.
		Because a cluster includes stars of many masses, that age can be fairly well defined.
		Using a sequence of clusters across many ages, it's possible to examine the evolution of various stellar properties.
		By observing many open clusters at a range of ages, we can examine how different stellar properties change with time.
		In particular, I focus on calibrating the evolution of rotation itself, and how magnetic fields and binary companions alter a star's rotational evolution.
		<!-- I measure rotation periods in open clusters using space-based missions like Kepler/K2 and TESS, then compare rotation distributions to model predictions at each cluster's age. -->
		</p>

		<p> I use data from a variety of space- and ground-based observatories.
		I measure rotation periods in open clusters using space-based missions like <a href="https://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/">Kepler/K2</a>
		and <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/tess-transiting-exoplanet-survey-satellite">TESS</a>.
		I measure stellar activity using spectra gathered at observatories like
		<a href="http://mdm.kpno.noao.edu/">MDM</a> or
		WIYN at
		<a href="https://www.noao.edu/kpno/">KPNO</a>, and various archival sources like the
		<a href="https://www.sdss.org/">SDSS</a>.
		And I look for binary companions two different ways: using high-resolution spectra from observatories like
		<a href="https://www.mmto.org/">MMT</a>,
		<a href="http://www.sao.arizona.edu/FLWO/whipple.html">FLWO</a>, and
		Magellan at	<a href="http://www.lco.cl/">Las Campanas Observatory</a>; and using adaptive optics or speckle imaging at
		<a href="http://www.keckobservatory.org/">Keck</a> or
		<a href="https://www.gemini.edu/">Gemini</a>.

                <BR>&nbsp;<BR>

		<p><b>The impact of companions on stellar rotation</b></p>
		<p> Models for stellar angular momentum evolution assume that stars are born and evolve in isolation (among other simplifying assumptions).
		However, just under half of all Sun-like stars have a stellar companion, so we must take into account the influence of binaries on cluster and field rotation period distributions.
		Lower-mass systems are less likely to be found in binaries, but a ~26% multiplicity fraction means binaries can still have a significant impact on rotational evolution.
		</p>

		<p> There are two primary ways for a binary companion to influence stellar angular momentum evolution: tidal interaction or disk disruption.
		A few percent of stars exist in very close binaries, where tidal forces alter both stars' rotation periods while circularizing their orbit.
		The presence of a disk is generally invoked to explain <i>slowly</i> rotating stars in the youngest clusters&mdash;the disks act as an angular momentum sink, allowing the stars to contract without increasing their rotation rate too much.
		Binary companions can disrupt these disks, and the stars will subsequently become rapid rotators.
		These stars do eventually spin down and join their single brethern on the slow rotator sequence, but if binaries comprise most or all rapid rotators at young ages, this drastically changes the necessary initial conditions for angular momentum evolution models.
		</p>

		<p>I study binaries using a variety of methods. To search for close binaries, which appear as a single point of light in most images, I use spectroscopy. As the stars orbit each other, their spectral lines shift back and forth periodically. Measurements of this shift are called radial velocity measurements, and we can use radial velocity measurements to measure the binary period (and other information about the orbit). </p>

		<p>I also use imaging to search for binaries. Advanced imaging techniques such as adaptive optics and speckle imaging allow the detection of companions that would otherwise be washed out by or blended with the image of the primary star.  </p>

                <BR>&nbsp;<BR>

		<p><b>Magnetic Activity</b></p>
		<p>Stellar rotation is tied to magnetism in two ways.
		First, stellar magnetic fields are generated when the star spins&mdash;stars are made up of charged particles, which generate a magnetic field if they move in a circle.
		Second, the large-scale magnetic field carries away mass via a stellar wind, and in the right configuration that leads to angular momentum loss as well.
		So rotation creates the magnetic field, but that also leads to slower rotation. </p>

		<p> We care about stellar magnetism because it affects planets around that star.
		Here on Earth, Solar stoms yield beautiful aurorae, but also interfere with communications. A big enough storm could disable satellites and the power grid.
		Much smaller stars have even stronger magnetic fields, and the increased rate of flares and CMEs could prevent life from ever forming there.
