		<!-- What am I actually trying to say here? Who is the audience?
	       I think in looking at this as both website design and prep for
			   my app statements, I'm not picking an audience. The audience for
			   the webpage should be undergrads and maybe public folks, largely
			   non-astronomers or non-cool-stars folks. The app materials can
			   be more technical; it look like most folks might give a 1-2
			   paragraph overview, then have 2-3 sections with 2-3 paragraphs each
			   giving details about areas of research (I like what Ryan does with
				 his glossary, too) -->


		<p><b>Stellar rotation in open clusters</b></p>
		<p> Open clusters are collections of stars that all share the same age, and because a cluster includes stars of many masses, that age can be fairly well defined. Using a sequence of clusters across many ages, it's possible to examine the evolution of various stellar properties.
		The core of my research is using open clusters to calibrate the evolution of stellar rotation.
		I measure rotation periods in open clusters using space-based missions like Kepler/K2 and TESS, then compare rotation distributions to model predictions at each cluster's age.</p>

		<p> My research initially focused on two nearby open clusters, the Hyades and Praesepe. I call these clusters "teenagers", because they aren't quite young (like star forming regions or the Pleiades cluster, for example) but they aren't old yet either (like the Sun or field stars). However, both clusters are the oldest clusters for which we can measure rotation periods (and some other properties) for M dwarfs, the lowest mass stars. Since M dwarfs are the most likely candidates for detecting a habitable earth-like planet in the near future, it's critical to understand how their rotation, magnetic activity, and multiplicity all evolve. </p>

		<p> My current focus for rotation is moving to younger ages, however. The youngest stars, still forming on the pre-main sequence, spin up as they contract. Once they reach the main sequence part of their lives, their rotation slows again thanks to magnetic braking by stellar winds. But the turnaround point between those two phases is currently unconstrained. To fill this gap, I received a TESS Guest Investigator Grant to work with students to measure rotation periods for southern open clusters and provide important contraints for theoretical models of rotational evolution. </p>


                <BR>&nbsp;<BR>

		<p><b>The impact of companions on stellar rotation</b></p>
		<p> Models for stellar angular momentum evolution assume that stars are born and evolve in isolation (among other simplifying assumptions).
		However, just under half of all Sun-like stars have a stellar companion, so we must take into account the influence of binaries on cluster and field rotation period distributions.
		Lower-mass systems are less likely to be found in binaries, but a ~26% multiplicity fraction means binaries can still have a significant impact on rotational evolution.
		</p>

		<p> There are two primary ways for a binary companion to influence stellar angular momentum evolution: tidal interaction or disk disruption.
		In very close binaries, tidal forces (stronger versions of what we observe between our Earth and Moon) alter both stars' rotation periods while circularizing their orbit. Typically, the stars are spun up, and are at least held at a relatively fast rotation period (P&lt;10&nbsp;days) for their entire main sequence lifetime. These stars will be the only remaining rapid rotators among old cluster or field stars.
		However, tides only affect binaries with P&lt;10&#8209;15&nbsp;days, and can only account for a few percent of rapid rotators in a given cluster.
	  </p>

		<p> All stars, including binary stars, are born with disks.
		Young stars contract as they form, and conservation of angular momentum should cause them to spin up.
		The presence of a disk is generally invoked to explain <i>slowly</i> rotating stars in the youngest clusters&mdash;the disks act as an angular momentum sink, allowing the stars to contract without increasing their rotation rate too much.
		A binary companion can disrupt these disks, and the stars will subsequently become rapid rotators.
		These stars do eventually spin down and join their single brethern on the slow rotator sequence, but if binaries comprise most or all rapid rotators at young ages, this drastically changes the necessary initial conditions for angular momentum evolution models.
		</p>

		<p> Furthermore, disk effects should show up as a correlation between initial rotation period and binary orbital separation.
		Observations of disks young clusters show that there is a correlation between the presence or size of disks in binary systems, and this should impact the rotation periods of these stars as well.
		At wide separations, binary stars do not impact each others' disks; we do not expect to see any correlation between $P_{orb}$ and $P_{rot}$ in this case, and the component stars should follow the same $P_{rot}$ distribution as single stars.
		At close separations, disk truncation will have a significant effect on the initial $P_{rot}$ distribution; these binaries will have initially short $P_{rot}$.
		Aside from these tidally locked systems, I expect that the discrepancy between single stars and close binaries will decrease with time&mdash;stars with companions beyond the tidal radius will spin down uninhibited and converge with single stars.
		</p>

		<p>I study binaries using a variety of methods. To search for close binaries, which appear as a single point of light in most images, I use spectroscopy. As the stars orbit each other, their spectral lines shift back and forth periodically. Measurements of this shift are called radial velocity measurements, and we can use radial velocity measurements to measure the binary period (and other information about the orbit). </p>

		<p>I also use imaging to search for binaries. Advanced imaging techniques such as adaptive optics and speckle imaging allow the detection of companions that would otherwise be washed out by or blended with the image of the primary star.  </p>

                <BR>&nbsp;<BR>

		<p><b>Magnetic Activity</b></p>
		<p>Stellar rotation is tied to magnetism in two ways.
			First, stellar magnetic fields are generated when the star spins&mdash;stars are made up of charged particles, which generate a magnetic field if they move in a circle.
			Second, the large-scale magnetic field carries away mass via a stellar wind, and in the right configuration that leads to angular momentum loss as well.
			So rotation creates the magnetic field, but that also leads to slower rotation. </p>

		<p> We care about stellar magnetism because it affects planets around that star.
		Here on Earth, Solar stoms yield beautiful aurorae, but also interfere with communications. A big enough storm could disable satellites and the power grid.
		Much smaller stars have even stronger magnetic fields, and the increased rate of flares and CMEs could prevent life from ever forming there.
